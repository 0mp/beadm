AUTOMOUNT is a devd(8) based flexible yet very simple automounter for FreeBSD.

Currently it supports these file systems:
 -- NTFS requires sysutils/fusefs-ntfs for R/W
 -- FAT/FAT32
 -- exFAT requires sysutils/fusefs-exfat
 -- EXT2
 -- EXT3
 -- EXT4 requires sysutils/fusefs-ext4fuse
 -- UFS

It keeps state of the mounted devices at /var/run/automount.state and logs
all activities to /var/log/automount.log file.

The place for the script is at /usr/local/sbin/automount.sh executable.

The only additional configuration it requires is to add these lines as
/usr/local/etc/devd/automount_devd.conf file, which would allow it to work.

Remember to restart /etc/rc.d/devd daemon after adding
/usr/local/etc/devd/automount_devd.conf file.

INSTALL:

# cp automount.sh        /usr/local/sbin/automount.sh
# cp automount.conf      /usr/local/etc/automount.conf
# cp automount_devd.conf /usr/local/etc/devd/automount_devd.conf
# /etc/rc.d/devd restart

Now plugin Your USB thumb drive ;)

Have Fun ;)
